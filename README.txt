The Odin Project: Landing Page

Main goal of the project was to practice all the concepts learnt about css, and especially flex-boxes.

I am pretty sure that I overcomplicated it on the card section, but still looks exactly how I wanted. The purpose was to learn and I did learn a lot just trying things by myself.
